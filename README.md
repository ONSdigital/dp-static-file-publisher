# DP Static File Publisher

## Introduction
The Static File Publisher API is part of the [Static Files System](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-static-files-compose).

This service is responsible for decrypting files that have been published.

It receives messages on two Kafka topics `static-file-published` (which has been deprecated, but not yet removed) and
`static-file-published-v2` which is the new topic that the [Files API](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-files-api) sends
publication messages on.

### Version 2 Functionality

When a publication message is received the service get the encryption key for the file from Vault.

The encryption key is used to get the unencrypted content of the file that has been published and make a copy of the content
in it unencrypted state on the public S3 bucket.

Once the file has been succesfully decrypted the service makes a HTTP API call back to [Files API](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-files-api)
to inform it that the file has been decrypted. once this has been done [Download Service](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-download-service)
stops streaming the file and starts redirecting requests for the decrypted files direct to the public bucket.

## Getting started

* Run `make debug`

* You can use the provided kafka producer to send kafka messages that will trigger a file publishing event, for testing proposes.
You can use it by running `go run cmd/producer/main.go`
Then you will need to introduce the source and destination paths, and the message will be sent.

## Dependencies

* No further dependencies other than those defined in `go.mod`
