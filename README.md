# DP Static File Publisher

## Introduction
The Static File Publisher API is part of the [Static Files System](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-static-files-compose).

It receives messages on two Kafka topics `static-file-published` (which has been deprecated, but not yet removed) and
`static-file-published-v2` which is the new topic that the [Files API](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-files-api) sends
publication messages on.

## Getting started

* Run `make debug`

* You can use the provided kafka producer to send kafka messages that will trigger a file publishing event, for testing proposes.
You can use it by running `go run cmd/producer/main.go`
Then you will need to introduce the source and destination paths, and the message will be sent.

## Dependencies

* No further dependencies other than those defined in `go.mod`
